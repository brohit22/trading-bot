# Trading Bot Simulation Backend (v1)

Welcome to the backend of the **Trading Bot Simulation** project. This application is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** and provides a RESTful API to simulate a trading bot that executes trades based on predefined rules. It tracks stock price changes and manages trades using a simple trading strategy.

## üöÄ Features

- üìà **Stock Price Monitoring**: Continuously monitors stock prices using mock data.
- ü§ñ **Automated Trading Bot**: Executes buy/sell trades based on predefined price movement strategies.
- üíº **Portfolio Tracking**: Tracks the bot's positions, balance, and overall profit/loss.
- üìä **Summary Reports**: Generates a summary report of all trades, with final profit/loss details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v14 or later recommended
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js

## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-bot-backend.git
   cd trading-bot-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root and add the following configuration:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   STOCK_SYMBOL=AAPL
   INITIAL_BALANCE=10000
   INTERVAL=5000
   ```

   - `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
   - `STOCK_SYMBOL`: The stock symbol to monitor (default: AAPL).
   - `INITIAL_BALANCE`: The initial cash balance for the trading bot.
   - `INTERVAL`: The interval (in milliseconds) for checking stock price updates.

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

## üö¶ Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the trading bot using the following API endpoints:

### API Endpoints

- **`GET /api/trading/status`**  
  Retrieves the current status of the trading bot (whether it's running or stopped).
- **`GET /api/trading/summary`**  
  Returns a summary report of all trades executed and the current profit/loss.
- **`POST /api/trading/start`**  
  Starts the trading bot and begins monitoring the stock price.
- **`POST /api/trading/stop`**  
  Stops the trading bot from executing further trades.

You can use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to interact with these endpoints.

## üîç Trading Logic

The bot follows a simple momentum-based trading strategy:

- **Buy**: When the stock price drops by **2%**.
- **Sell**: When the stock price rises by **3%**.

This strategy is implemented in the `TradingStrategy` class. Feel free to modify or replace it with more complex algorithms based on your needs.

## üß™ Mock API

The application uses a mock API (`services/mockApi.js`) to simulate real-time stock prices. In real-world applications, you can replace this with an actual stock market API to fetch live data.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`app.js`**: Main Express application file.
- **`routes/tradingRoutes.js`**: API routes for controlling the trading bot.
- **`services/tradingBot.js`**: Core logic for the trading bot.
- **`services/mockApi.js`**: Simulates stock price data.
- **`models/tradingStrategy.js`**: Defines the trading strategy (buy/sell rules).
- **`models/profitLossTracker.js`**: Tracks and calculates profit/loss from trades.
- **`.env`**: Configuration file for environment variables.

## üéØ Future Improvements

- Enhance trading strategies with more sophisticated algorithms.
- Integrate with real-time stock market data APIs.
- Add **backtesting** capabilities to simulate trading performance on historical data.
- Improve logging and analytics for better insights into bot performance.
- Implement **user authentication** for secure API access.
- Build a **frontend interface** for easy interaction with the bot.
